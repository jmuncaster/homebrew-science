      To use this formula with NVIDIA graphics cards you will need to
      download and install the CUDA drivers and tools from nvidia.com.

          https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

      Select "Mac OS" as the Operating System and then select the
      'Developer Drivers for MacOS' package.
      You will also need to download and install the 'CUDA Toolkit' package.

      The `nvcc` has to be in your PATH then (which is normally the case).
